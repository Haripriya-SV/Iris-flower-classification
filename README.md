# Iris-flower-classification
Machine learning is almost everywhere nowadays. It’s become more and more necessary day by day. From the recommendation of what to buy to recognizing a person, robotics, everywhere is machine learning. So in this project, we’ll create the “Hello World” of machine learning which means Iris flower classification.

Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.

The variables are:

sepal_length: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.
sepal_width: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.
petal_length: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.
petal_width: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.
class: Iris Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, used as the target.
